# Subway surfers controlled by moves from camera

The project allows you to play Subway surfers using body movements. The image is divided into 5 areas, which correspond to the actions in the game:
- **Center** - the character runs in the center
- **Left** - the character runs on the left side
- **Right** - the character runs on the right side
- **Crouch** - the character does a somersault
- **Hands up** - the character jumps

**The gameplay is based on the browser version of the game at the link

The program that reads the new position of the character on the captured image sends a signal that maps the arrow signal
